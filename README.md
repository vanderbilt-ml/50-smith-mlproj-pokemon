For performance metrics, the primary focus is just on accuracy, with a goal of at least 50% accuracy. If I were to find a good single value to test classification against as positive or negative, a confusion matrix may be used as well.

Brian - For the performance metric, can you tell the "VALUE" in knowing the Pokemon type based on an image. For example, in the stone tool project the professor mentioned, the VALUE was knowing where stone tools were made based on the sample containing the stone shards. How does it help you to correctly identify the Pokemon type from an image? Will it help in winning battles if you know more details about the Pokemon you are fighting?

Brian - If the value is in helping you win battles, then what are the consequences of the model predicting correctly or incorrectly? For example, how bad is it if the model predicts incorrectly?

Brian - Please note, this is my first machine learning class so please don't think my comments are expert comments. Hopefully, the professor or TA reviews and confirms if my comments are correct.
